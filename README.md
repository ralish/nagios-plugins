A random collection of Nagios/Icinga plugins I've written or improved:

 * check_reboot_req: Checks if the Ubuntu server has a pending reboot
 * check_xpect: Improved version of that provided by [xpect.io](https://xpect.io)
  - Supports checking an individual expectation instead of an account-wide check
  - Handles HTTPError exceptions that may occur (bad auth, invalid expectation)
  - Some minor stylistic/formatting fixes and general durability improvements
